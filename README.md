# SpaceX F9R-v2 concept

This is a concept for an almost entirely reusable Falcon 9. Both
stages can be reused, along with the interstage; the payload
attachment mechanism is jettisoned and lost along with both fairings.

# Stage one

The first stage is identical to the current F9R-v1.1 first stage.

# Stage two

The second stage reenters the atmosphere upside-down, with the top
side of the stage entering first. The top side has a heatshield, which
protects the body. It lands upside-down with eight SuperDraco engines
in a configuration similar to the Dragon v2.
